## Disclaimer

0. This was my first aproach into  `vuejs`. As Always , there must be things that could or should be done in a better way.

1. No unit test were implemented. Never got the chance to work in a project where unit testing was needed so no expirience on that. Having mentioned it, In ideal scenario I would have tested the connection with the etherium network and the interaction with the smart contract since the rest its mostly showng data. Dont know if testing framework UI is a thing haha ðŸ™ƒ

3. Tailwind CSS was chosen for styling. Parcticity whas the main reason, but also because no SCSS experiece.
